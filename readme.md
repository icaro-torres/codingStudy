# 📗 Programming Study Repository

Welcome to my study repository! Here I document my journey as a developer, gathering code snippets, notes, and projects related to my learning in various programming languages.

## Focus Languages

- **Python**

    Studying logic, automation, data structures, libraries, and frameworks.

- **JavaScript**

  Practicing web development, DOM manipulation, APIs, and asynchronous programming concepts.

## Future Plans

- **C** — my next milestone!  
  I want to dive deeper into low-level programming, memory management, and core computing concepts.

- **Other languages**  
  I'm always open to learning new technologies and languages as I grow in my career.
